      According to a recent animal study published in the European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology, the answer is yes!
      </p>
      <p>
      Here's how:
      </p>
      <p>
      Scientists have discovered keeping your blood sugar healthy boils down to a simple enzyme in your body.
      </p>
      <p>
      If this enzyme is shut down, that leads to...
      </p>
      <p>
      <i>&#10004; Concerning <strong>insulin levels</strong>...</i>
      </p>
      <p>
      <i>&#10004; Struggling to keep your <strong>HbA1c</strong> in the normal range...</i>
      </p>
      <p>
      <i>&#10004; Or frustration with your <strong>belly fat</strong> and <strong>fatigue</strong>...</i>
      </p>
      On the other hand, if this enzyme is active in your body...
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid container-pad bg-2">
      <div class="container">
        <h1 class="display-4 font-weight-bold">You can have the PERFECT blood sugar, every time you check...</h1>
        <br>
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">You'll marvel at your steady, low, natural insulin levels...</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid bg-3">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4 bg-3-col">
          <img src="css/DoctorAndLady_6.png">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 bg-3-col testimonial"> 
          <div>
            <p>
              You might even get a thumbs up from your doctor, after confirming your HbA1c is the best it's been in years
              And also hear from your doctor that whatever you've been doing to lose those extra pounds:
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>"Keep it up, because it's working like crazy!"</i>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container container-pad">
      <p>
      So what does this have to do with eating chocolate?
      </p>
      <p>
      Simple... it turns out you can activate this enzyme by eating chocolate! Seriously!
      </p>
      <p>
      If you're skeptical, I completely understand. <strong>And why wouldn't you be?</strong>
      </p>
      After all, if you're concerned about your blood sugar... everyone out there is telling you something different...
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid container-pad bg-4">
      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="font-weight-bold">You CAN switch it back on</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          Even if you're tired, out of shape, and have poor eating habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your age doesn't matter either.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when you do flip your AMPK on, you won't believe the results...
        </p>
        <p>
          You can keep your blood sugar healthy and stay sensitive to your natural insulin... so you can feel steady energy, look thin and trim...
        </p>
        <p>
          ...and stop stressing... because you know your numbers are in the normal range.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the most incredible part is, it's simpler than you think.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can do this right in the comfort of your own home...
